# BACKEND JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to create dynamically updated content, control multimedia, animate images, 
and do a variety of other things. It was previously known as a client-side language that was used to make websites look more 
dynamic and interactive. However, in today's world, it is a universal language that can be used for backend development in many ways. 
Developers use it for server-side programming to create web applications or facilitate development with JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

The server side of web development where you, the developer, write code to power the web application, is referred to as backend development. 
The frontend is what the user sees and interacts with while browsing the web. The backend, which typically runs on a web server, is what 
drives the frontend.
